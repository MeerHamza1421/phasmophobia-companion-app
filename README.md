# Phasmophobia Companion App

![](beta_demo.gif)

This is a React project bootstrapped with Create React App. This is a purely front-end application.

It aims to help the 2020 hit PC game Phasmophobia assess the possible ghosts they are dealing with by incorporating the capabilities of the in-game journal and expanding them to help the players' guesswork.

It has a session in which the user inputs the evidence with which the ghost has interacted so far, the evidence the ghost **didn't** interact with and returns what the possibilities are, what the impossibilities are and whether it could only be one option.

Temporarily hosted on http://www.rmcastilho.com/phasmophobia-companion/

## Running the project

As described, this is not a complex project. You may clone this repository locally and run

`yarn start` or `npm run build` 

## Contributing to the project

Phasmophobia players' contributions are welcomed and encouraged. I do reinforce that this is not a complex project, though.

I'd gladly accept submissions on smooth transitions and effects, better styling and increased functionalities that actually help move the project forward.

## Development Roadmap - Near Future Additions
- Responsive design
- Better styling, transitions and effects
- A section with information on equipment and how to use them
- A section with information on evidence and how to gather them
- Clicking on ghost cards will provide further information on them
